# Video Transcription Pipeline (Vosk, Punctuator2, Languagetool)

This project is a quick video transcription pipeline for me to use in university.
Input a folder of videos and get out transcriptions with medium quality and additionally punctuations and grammar checking done.
Pipeline script file can be easily edited to grammar check subtitles output or other adaptions.
A focus was easy and working setup as opposed to [some projects](https://github.com/uhh-lt/subtitle2go) I got inspired by while developing this and struggled to set up.
